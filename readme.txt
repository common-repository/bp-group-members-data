Choose which fields appear on the "member cards" on member list pages, such as Groups.

== Description ==

Without the plugin, if you go to a Group and click on Members you see the following info about each member on the member's respective "card":  
- username 
- profile image
- join time/freshness

This plugin enables the Admin to choose which X-Profile fields shall be displayed on these cards, thereby allowing you to make your BuddyPress community truly yours!

Hence, it enables the members to make their elevator pitch - a quick glance at the member list is all that's needed to check which members may or may not be relevant, useful, or needed for or interested in a particular task, event, or group, etc.
